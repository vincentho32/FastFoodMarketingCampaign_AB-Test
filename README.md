# Fast Food Marketing Campaign :  AB-Testing

## Authors

-   Vincent Ho

## Background

A fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are
still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting
the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest
effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several
randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each
location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the
first four weeks.
