# Fast Food Marketing Campaign :  AB-Testing

## Authors

## About

A fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are
still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting
the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest
effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several
randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each
location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the
first four weeks.

## Data

The data is found on
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test)
under IBM Watson Analytics Marketing Campaign. All rights belong to the
respective owner.

Each row in the dataset contains a different Pokemon with various
attributes. The attributes are measurements of the base Pokemon, such as
`attack`, `speed` or `defense`.The different types of Pokemon are
closely related to the other attributes it possesses. For example, a
rock type Pokemon is likely to have higher defensive statistics (such as
`defense` or `health points`) as well as rock-type abilities. It is also
most likely to be coloured grey. A complete description of each feature
in the raw dataset is listed below:
